Greetings! My name is Yuvraj and I'm a software engineer with a passion for Machine Learning & Data Engineering.

I'm currently working at UNSW as a data engineer for the Clean Air Schools project. I'm also a Research Assistant at the Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW as a part of the ARC Center of Excellence Climate Extremes office. I recently finished Honours Thesis on Concept Learning Neural Networks with Distinction!

I love helping researchers accomplish their goals using proper data engineering and software practices. Fascinated by machine learning, building software, making usable front-ends, scaling back-ends. Massive advocate for the power of generative AI and prompting.

Always tinkering with the latest and greatest in the AI space. Always down to chat about anything neural nets, climate, dogs, meditation and space.

Love working with:
  - Python (Loves pyTorch)
  - R
  - Java
  - JavaScript (NodeJS, ReactJS)

Part of UNSW CSESoc's Projects team, developer for discord bot.
